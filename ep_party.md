# EP Party! – Summary

**Video context:** This video features a “EP party,” a discussion centred on earnings‑pivot (EP) setups.  The episode was recorded roughly a year before November 2025 and runs about 48 minutes.  It follows the release of multiple companies’ earnings reports and examines how to trade them.

## Key Points

- **Earnings pivot definition.**  An EP occurs when a stock reports earnings and then breaks out of a base on unusually high volume.  Kullamägi describes the characteristics he looks for: a strong earnings beat, significant volume expansion, and the stock clearing a multi‑week consolidation area.
- **Recent EP examples.**  He reviews several recent trades that triggered EP setups.  For each, he highlights the technical pattern on the daily chart, the volume signature, and how quickly the price moved after the breakout.  Some examples worked well, while others failed—he explains what distinguished winners from losers.
- **Entry and exit strategies.**  The video goes into detail about how to enter an EP: wait for the initial breakout, then buy a pullback toward the breakout level if the stock holds above it.  Stops are placed just below the pivot area, and partial profits are taken as the stock extends.
- **Market context.**  Kullamägi notes that EPs tend to work best when the overall market is supportive.  He compares the current environment with earlier periods and warns that if the market is choppy, many EPs will fail.
- **Psychology of trading earnings.**  He stresses not to “front‑run” earnings.  Instead of guessing, traders should wait for the actual reaction.  Patience is key because EPs often consolidate before making a decisive move.

## Takeaways

The “EP party” demonstrates how earnings‑pivot setups can be lucrative but require discipline.  Kullamägi provides concrete rules for identifying and trading EPs, emphasizing volume confirmation and proper risk management.  The episode underscores that while EPs can deliver big gains, traders should remain flexible and avoid forcing trades when the market backdrop is unfavorable.
