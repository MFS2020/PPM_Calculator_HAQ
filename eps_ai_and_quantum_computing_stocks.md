# EPs, AI and Quantum Computing Stocks – Summary

**Video context:** In this 1 hour 18 minute discussion from early 2023, Kullamägi examines the intersection of earnings‑pivot setups (EPs) with emerging themes such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.  The video blends his usual technical analysis with commentary on market‑leading sectors.

## Highlights

- **Emerging technology themes.**  He notes that AI‑related and quantum computing stocks were among the strongest performers in the market.  Companies benefiting from machine learning and next‑generation computing were breaking out of bases on heavy volume.
- **Applying EP frameworks.**  Kullamägi demonstrates how traditional EP criteria—earnings surprises and post‑report breakouts—can apply to new‑economy stocks.  He reviews examples where AI or quantum companies posted earnings and then rallied strongly, illustrating how he traded them.
- **Volatility considerations.**  Because many of these names are relatively new and volatile, he cautions viewers to size positions carefully.  Stops should be wider to accommodate bigger price swings, and traders might need to sell portions more quickly to lock in profits.
- **Long‑term potential vs. trading setups.**  While some viewers asked whether they should invest long‑term in AI and quantum plays, Kullamägi distinguishes between long‑term investing and short‑term trading.  He suggests that the technical criteria for EPs remain the same regardless of the underlying story, but traders must be realistic about the volatility these themes carry.

## Conclusions

This video integrates thematic investing with Kullamägi’s technical method.  He argues that while the hype around AI and quantum computing is justified, traders should still adhere to disciplined entries and exits.  By applying EP principles to these high‑growth sectors, traders can potentially capture outsized gains while controlling risk.
